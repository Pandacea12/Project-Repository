## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass


### What I learned

How to use the "display: none" property to easily switch picture between mobile and desktop sizes.

After struggling for a bit with the small white band under the picture in the Desktop version, I realized one of the uses of the "display: block" property because said white band was a space for descenders since img is an inline element by default.

### Continued development

Keeping in mind the "display: none" technique for pictures will be useful in the future.
